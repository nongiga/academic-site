I am a first-year PhD student at Columbia University's department of Systems Biology, and a recipient of the Open Philanthropy Project Early Career Funding. My research predominantly focuses on how to represent data collected in biology, such as genomes and proteomes, in a manner that makes their analysis easier. Previously, I was a student at Kishony Lab at the Technion, where I harnessed novel genomic approaches and big data to investigate how bacterial pathogens evolve upon recurring infections.
